**WORK IN PROGRESS**

<img src="src/stories/assets/work-in-progress.jpg" width="200" height="180"/>

My custom design system on top of [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), with a bunch of components to be able to fast prototype new pages and products

## Installation

This project is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pautena/react-design-system).

npm:

```bash
npm install @pautena/react-design-system @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @mui/lab @mui/material @mui/x-data-grid react-dom react-router-dom
